ReflectedData CSharp Library by Sivan Segev
--------------------------------------------

This library was initially created around 2008 to wrap around Microsoft's data libraries to quickly access and 
manipulate data files.

For some usages, this library requires an installation of Microsoft's data 
engines, as of 6/17/2020 these can be found at the following links:

Data Engine 2010

or
Data Engine 2016
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920

It appears that to access MDB or XLS files, the base libraries come with latest versions of Windows.
